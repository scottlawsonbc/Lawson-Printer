==Introduction==
Laswon is a 3D printer designed to have high mechanical stiffness, accuracy, and reliability. The Lawson design appeals to a wide audience through component substitutions, which can be tailored for higher accuracy and precision, or lower component costs.

==Features==
* High mechanical stiffness.
* All mechanical components (excluding extruder + electronics) can be obtained from only two suppliers.
* High accuracy printer. Linear motion components use high quality parts.
* Easy to assemble
* Components can be substituted to achieve higher quality or lower build costs, appealing to a wide audience.

==Main improvements==
The following is a list of the main improvements made upon the Prusa Mendel Iteration 2

* Enhanced frame rigidity (prevents x backlash)
* Easy assembly
* Parametric files for multiple sizes/bearings or bushings

==History==

==Printed Parts==

The STL files to make the printer can be found at [[Clone_wars:_Prusa_iteraci%C3%B3n_3]]. 
and here zipped up:  [[file:clonewars.zip]]
Please note that the zipped files are not compatible with holes for the Z axis brackets in the Prusa3ALU-*.dxf drawings, at least the ones in the old/ folder in github. Also, the models for Y-axis brackets are for M8 rods. Compiling your own and investigating the Prusa github packages is highly recommended!


RP every .scad in this directory (except complete-printer) once.
Aim for 0.3mm layers and 2.2 extrusion width (width over thickness),
for 0.66mm stroke width. Printer is tested at this setting.

Using doc/complete-printer.scad as a visual clue and doc/manual.txt as a
guide, build the printer.

==Frame type==




----

===Single Sheet Frame===

This is a frame created from a single sheet of metal, typically Aluminum, but can also be made from various Materials with a thickness greater than 6mm / 0.25 inch

'''pro:'''

- Looks professional (subjective)

'''con:'''

- Requires specialised tools (e.g. Water flow jet cutter)

- Less rigid connection between XZ-frame and Y-frame part, however this can be somewhat rectified by the TwelvePro variant, which provides additional frame support.



----

=== Wood Sheet frame ===

[[File:Prusa-i3-wood-in-melamime.jpg|thumb|none|alt=Wood Style Sheet Frame Made Out Of Melamime|Wood Style Sheet Frame Made Out Of Melamime]]

This is a version of the sheet frame that is designed to be laser cut out of wood or plastic (eg. acrylic) if you don't have access to a waterjet cutter. The only difference is that this version has support gussets on the back side of the vertical frame (the side that doesn't have the z threaded rods).

Construction is the same.

'''pro:'''

- Looks professional (subjective)

'''con:'''

- Requires specialized tools (e.g.laser cutter)

- Less rigid connection between XZ-frame and Y-frame part (Connects in the same way as the alu sheet frame)
